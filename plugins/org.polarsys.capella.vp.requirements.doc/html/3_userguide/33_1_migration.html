	<h1>Migration procedure</h1>
	<p>As specified in the previous section, after a Reqif import a new
		file .bridgetraces is created aside the .capella file which is used
		for successive imports. Models that have been created in previous
		versions of Capella need to be migrated for this version, including
		the .bridgetraces file.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the .bridgetraces file is present in your Capella project,
			it will be automatically migrated during the migration procedure. For
			more details regarding the migration please of Capella projects
			please consult <b>Capella Guide / User Manual / First steps with
				Capella / How to Migrate Capella Project</b>
